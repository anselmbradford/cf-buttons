# cf-buttons

Button styles including default, secondary, destructive, disabled, super, and
compound buttons, button links, buttons with icons, and button groups.
This component can be used by itself, but it was made for Capital Framework,
a new front end framework developed at the
[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://cfpb.github.io/).

(Includes [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for icons until the CFPB icon
font is released.)

If you would like to take advantage of more components or if you're new to
Capital Framework, we encourage you to [start here](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/).
